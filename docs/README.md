Get all componented connected and the entire pipeline running in whatever form as quick as possible.
### Phase 3 - Feature Complete Phase
All main features implemented. Design Freeze.
### Phase 4 - Stabilizing Phase
Start implementation of refactoring, OOP and modular programming. Build infrastructure for health-checks, cybersecurity, exception and logging if not already implemented.
### Phase 5 - Data Product Design Start
Assessment of 'Data Product' requirements, design and planning of data transformations required at each point of the pipeline to deliver the required 'Data Product' to the consumer.
### Phase 6 - Expansion of Data Product Offerings
Exploration of other data sources, and new data products from these new data sources. ie: X/TikTok sentiment data sources and delivering a sentiment analysis front-end.
